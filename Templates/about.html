                    <mark>PURPOSE Video summarization is to generate a short summary of the content of a longer video
                    document by
                    selecting and presenting the most informative or interesting materials for potential users.</mark>

                        <p class="mb-2 me-4 text-sm">The output summary is usually composed of a set of keyframes or video clips extracted from the original video with some editing process. The aim of video summarization is to speed up browsing of a large collection of video data,
                            and achieve efficient access and representation of the video content. By watching the summary, users can make quick decisions on the usefulness of the video. Dependent on applications and target users, the evaluation of summary
                            often involves usability studies to measure the content informativeness and quality of a summary.Video summarization provides a condensed or summarized version of a video stream by analyzing the video content. Automatic summarization
                            of consumer videos is an important tool that facilitates efficient browsing, searching, and album creation in the large amount of consumer video collections. The past decade has seen explosive growth in the ability of individuals
                            to create and/or capture digital video, slowly leading to large personal and corporate digital video archives. In the corporate arena, there is a growing need for video summarization. For instance, a company that uses video
                            technology to secure its buildings may wish to summarize the surveillance video so that only important events are included in the summary.PROJECT SCOPE Enormous number of video recordings are being created and shared on th

                    <mark>There are broadly two types of extractive summarization tasks depending
                    on what the summarization program focuses on. The first is generic
                    summarization, which focuses on obtaining a </mark>

                        <summary> <strong>Read More</strong> </summary>
                        <p class="mb-2 me-4 text-sm">generic summary or abstract of the collection (whether documents, or sets of images, or videos, news stories etc.). The second is query relevant summarization, sometimes called query-based summarization, which summarizes objects
                            specific to a query. Summarization systems are able to create both queryrelevant text summaries and generic machine-generated summaries depending on what the user needs. An example of a summarization problem is document summarization,
                            which attempts to automatically produce an abstract from a given document. Sometimes one might be interested in generating a summary from a single source document, while others can use multiple source documents (for example,
                            a cluster of articles on the same topic. This problem is called multi-document summarization. A related application is summarizing news articles. Imagine a system, which automatically pulls together news articles on a given
                            topic (from the web), and concisely represents the latest news as a summary. Image collection summarization is another- of images. A summary in this context is useful to show the most representative images of results in an
                            image collection exploration system. Video summarization is a related domain, where the system automatically creates a trailer of a long video. This also has applications in consumer or personal videos, where one might want
                            to skip the boring or repetitive actions.

                            used for text summarization: ● Extractive Summarization: This is where the model identifies the important sentences and phrases from the original text and only outputs those● Abstractive Summarization: The model produces a
                            completely different text that is shorter than the original, it generates new sentences in a new form, just like humans do. In this project, we will use transformers for this approach. In this milestone, we will use Hugging
                            Face's transformers library in Python to perform abstractive text summarization on the transcript obtained from previous milestone. </p>

                    Using the detection scores of four audio classes and the audio features, an

                        <p class="mb-2 me-4 text-sm">it is important to include a nice mix of audio clips where the four audio classes present, and to include various examples reflecting different stages of the audio sound. Addressing these issues, we first cluster the audio frames
                            (25 ms with 10 ms hops) into N clusters according to low-level audio features, by using the K-means algorithm. Then we keep the largest M clusters, where M is determined by the percentage P of audio frames in these M clusters.
                            For each cluster, we select K ≤ 4 audio frames. Each audio frame corresponds to the best identified frame for each of the four audio classes. There is an option of not selecting any audio frame for some classes if the detection
                            score for these classes are too low. After that, we locate the candidate audio segments that contains the selected K audio frames. since some candidate segments for different clusters may be the same, we have Q ≤ K ×M candidate
                            audio segments in total. The chosen candidate audio segments are then expended into audio clips with greater than L-second length each (if possible), by appending the audio segments before and after alternatively. The majority
                            of audio frames in an appended audio segment have to be from the same cluster as the majority of audio frames in the candidate audio </p>
